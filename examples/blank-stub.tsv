TYPE	NAME	COLOR	SHORTNAME
comment	The above header columns must be in ALLCAPS
Comment	Begin lines with 'comment\t' for a safe comment experience
COMMENT	Lines that aren't formed to expectation will not halt the program but will throw errors to stderr
comment	The accepted values for TYPE are 'Comment', 'Event', 'Timeline', 'Object', 'Combiner', and 'Character'
Comment	In general, it is best to order the input file so the order is Timelines > Events > Characters > Combiners.
Comment This ordering is not enforced, but breaking it increases the likelihood of a failure to parse due to missing reference.
COmmEnT    notice how this line and the one above	give an error during parsing because they used spaces after 'Comment'
Comment	See the module docstring for storyboard.py for further format details
